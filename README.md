# Posterior-Prediction-with-Chronic-Kidney-Disease

## Objective:
Developed predictive models using Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with logistic and binomial regression to predict the presence or absence of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKS) based on clinical and laboratory data.

## Reference
Used and gone through the following paper for better understanding of the data.
